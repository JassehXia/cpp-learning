# Project-Based C++ Learning Path

This curriculum focuses on "how to build" rather than just "how it works."

## Phase 1: The Basics - CLI Utility
**Project**: **Multi-Tool Calculator** (Basic Arithmetics, Unit Converter)
- **Concepts**: Variable types, cin/cout, conditional logic, loops.
- **Goal**: Master basic syntax and structured programming.

## Phase 2: Core Concepts - Contact Manager
**Project**: **File-Persistent Contact System**
- **Concepts**: Arrays/Vectors, `std::string`, File I/O (`fstream`), Pointers, and Structs.
- **Goal**: Understand data persistence and basic memory organization.

## Phase 3: OOP & Memory - Retro Arcade Game (SKIPPED)
**Project**: **Snake or Tetris**
- *Note: Moved directly to Phase 4 per user request.*

## Phase 4: Modern C++ - Multithreaded Task Runner (DONE)
- **Goal**: Mastered threads, mutexes, and smart pointers.

## Phase 5: Professional Engineering - Capstone
**Project**: **Multithreaded HTTP Server**
- **Concepts**: Sockets/Networking (Winsock), String Parsing, Buffer Management, CMake, Professional Project Structure.
- **Goal**: Combine everything to build a real-world infrastructure component.

## Phase 6: Backend Engineering - Capstone
**Project**: **Mini-Redis (In-Memory Key-Value Store)**
- **Concepts**: TCP Sockets (for commands), Thread-safe Data Structures (`std::unordered_map` + Mutex), Concurrency Patterns, Memory Management (LRU Eviction), and Protocol Design.
- **Goal**: Build a high-performance infrastructure component that other applications could use to store data.
