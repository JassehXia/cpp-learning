# Project-Based C++ Learning Path

This curriculum focuses on "how to build" rather than just "how it works."

## Phase 1: The Basics - CLI Utility
**Project**: **Multi-Tool Calculator** (Basic Arithmetics, Unit Converter)
- **Concepts**: Variable types, cin/cout, conditional logic, loops.
- **Goal**: Master basic syntax and structured programming.

## Phase 2: Core Concepts - Contact Manager
**Project**: **File-Persistent Contact System**
- **Concepts**: Arrays/Vectors, `std::string`, File I/O (`fstream`), Pointers, and Structs.
- **Goal**: Understand data persistence and basic memory organization.

## Phase 3: OOP & Memory - Retro Arcade Game (SKIPPED)
**Project**: **Snake or Tetris**
- *Note: Moved directly to Phase 4 per user request.*

## Phase 4: Modern C++ - Multithreaded Task Runner
**Project**: **Concurrent File Downloader/Processor**
- **Concepts**: STL (`map`, `unordered_map`, `algorithm`), Smart Pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`), Lambda functions, Threads (`std::thread`).
- **Goal**: Write safe, efficient modern C++ code.

## Phase 5: Professional Engineering - Capstone
**Project**: **A Custom Library or Application** (e.g., a simple HTTP server or Math Library)
- **Concepts**: CMake, Unit Testing (GTest/Catch2), Version Control (Git), Documentation (Doxygen).
- **Goal**: Master the professional C++ lifecycle.
